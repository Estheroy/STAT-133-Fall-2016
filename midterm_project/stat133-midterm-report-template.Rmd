# Set Up: Packages and Functions

You will need to use the following packages: `"stringr"`, `"ggplot2"`, 
`"dplyr"`, and `"readr"`. You can also use any other packages. If you don't 
have any of the packages installed in your computer, install them first 
(outside this Rmd).

```{r}
# use this code chunk to load all the packages that you will be using
# (do not include commands to install the packages)

library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

```

To "import" the functions in your R script file, use the function `source()`

```{r}
# source your functions
source("~/Desktop/STAT 133/stat133-my-repo/midterm_project/stat133-midterm-functions-template.R")
```


# Import Raw Data in R

We are assuming that you already downloaded a copy of the CSV files with the
raw data (you don't need to show the commands you used for this step): 

- `womens-high-jump-raw.csv`
- `mens-high-jump-raw.csv`

Now, use the function `read_csv()` from the package `"readr"` to import the 
data sets in R.

```{r}
# download.file(
#   url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucb-stat133/stat133-fall-2016/master
#   /data/womens-high-jump-raw.csv', 
#   destfile = '~/Desktop/STAT 133/stat133-my-repo/midterm_project/
#   womens-high-jump-raw.csv')

# read in womens-high-jump-raw.csv
womens_high_jump_raw = read_csv(
  '~/Desktop/STAT 133/stat133-my-repo/midterm_project/womens-high-jump-raw.csv',
  col_names = TRUE)

# check structure with str()
str(womens_high_jump_raw)

```

```{r}
# download.file(
#   url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucb-stat133/stat133-fall-2016/
#   master/data/mens-high-jump-raw.csv', 
#   destfile = '~/Desktop/STAT 133/stat133-my-repo/midterm_project/
#   mens-high-jump-raw.csv')

# read in mens-high-jump-raw.csv
mens_high_jump_raw = read_csv(
  '~/Desktop/STAT 133/stat133-my-repo/midterm_project/mens-high-jump-raw.csv',
  col_names = TRUE)

# check structure with str()
str(mens_high_jump_raw)

```


# Cleaning raw data of women's high jump world records

We'll start by cleaning the women's data set.


### Column `Height`

To clean the contents of column `Height`, use your function to extract height
values to generate a new __numeric__ vector `height` with the values of meters:

```{r}
# vector 'height' with numeric values of height in meters
height = extract_height(womens_high_jump_raw$Height)

```


### Column `Athlete`

The column `Athlete` contains the name of the athlete, together with the 
country (inside parenthesis). Use your function to extract the athlete's name
to create a new __character__ vector `athlete`:

```{r}
# vector 'athlete' with character values of athlete's name
athlete = extract_athlete(womens_high_jump_raw$Athlete)

```

Likewise, use your function to extract the country names to create a new __character__ vector `country` that contains the initials of the countries:

```{r}
# character vector 'country' with country abbreviations
country = extract_country(womens_high_jump_raw$Athlete)

```


### Column `Date`

The column `Date` contains the dates when the records were established. From
this column you have to create three new vectors: `day`, `month`, and `year`.

- Use your function to extract the day numbers to create a new __numeric__ 
vector `day`:

```{r}
# numeric vector 'day'
day = extract_day(womens_high_jump_raw$Date)

```

- Use your function to extract the month names to create a new __character__ 
vector `month`:

```{r}
# character vector 'month'
month = extract_month(womens_high_jump_raw$Date)

```

- Use your function to extract the year number to create a new __numeric__ 
vector `year`:

```{r}
# numeric vector 'year'
year = extract_year(womens_high_jump_raw$Date)

```

Likewise, use your function to reformat date to create a new vector `new_date` 
by reformatting the values in column `Date`:

```{r}
# 'new_date' vector of class "Date"
new_date = reformat_date(womens_high_jump_raw$Date)

```


### Column `Place`

Use your function to remove brackets---and the content inside them--- to
create a new character vector `city` from column `Place`:

```{r}
# character vector 'city' with name of city
city = remove_brackets(womens_high_jump_raw$Place)

```


### New vector `gender`

Create a __character__ vector `gender` filled with `"female"` values, having 
length equal to the number of rows in the women's data set.

```{r}
# vector 'gender'
gender = rep("female", nrow(womens_high_jump_raw))

```


### New data frame `womens`

Use the vectors `height`, `athlete`, `gender`, `country`, `city`, `new_date`, 
`day`, `month`, and `year` to build a new data frame `womens`. The column corresponding to `new_date` should have name `"date"`. Do NOT convert
character strings as factors:

```{r}
# data frame 'womens'
womens = data.frame(
  height = height,
  athlete = athlete,
  gender = gender,
  country = country,
  city = city,
  date = new_date,
  day = day,
  month = month,
  year = year,
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
```

-----


# Cleaning raw data of men's high jump world records

In this section you will clean the men's data set.


### Column `Height`

To clean the contents of column `Height`, use your function to extract height
values to generate a new __numeric__ vector `height` with the values of meters:

```{r}
# vector 'height' with numeric values of height in meters
height = extract_height(mens_high_jump_raw$Height)
```


### Column `Athlete`

The column `Athlete` contains the name of the athlete, together with the 
country (inside parenthesis). Use your function to extract the athlete's name
to create a new __character__ vector `athlete`:

```{r}
# vector 'athlete' with character values of athlete's name
athlete = extract_athlete(mens_high_jump_raw$Athlete)

```

Likewise, use your function to extract the country names to create a new
__character__ vector `country` that contains the initials of the countries:

```{r}
# character vector 'country' with country abbreviations
country = extract_country(mens_high_jump_raw$Athlete)

```


### Column `Venue`

The column `Venue` contains the name of the city where the record was 
established. As you can tell from the values in this column, some names contain 
more than just the name of the city (e.g. some include US State, some include
name of country). Use your function to extract the name of the city in 
order to obtain a new __character__ vector `city`:

```{r}
# character vector 'city' with name of city
city = extract_city(mens_high_jump_raw$Venue)

```



### Column `Date`

The column `Date` contains the dates when the records were established. As you 
can tell from the values in this column, they also contain extra characters 
(numbers inside brackets). 

Use your function to remove brackets---and the content inside them--- to
create a new character vector `clean_date`:

```{r}
# vector 'clean_date'
clean_date = remove_brackets(mens_high_jump_raw$Date)

```

Now take `clean_date` to create three new vectors: `day`, `month`, and `year`.

- Use your function to extract the day numbers to create a new __numeric__ 
vector `day`:

```{r}
# numeric vector 'day'
day = extract_day(clean_date)

```

- Use your function to extract the month names to create a new __character__ 
vector `month`:

```{r}
# character vector 'month'
month = extract_month(clean_date)

```

- Use your function to extract the year number to create a new __numeric__ 
vector `year`:

```{r}
# numeric vector 'year'
year = extract_year(clean_date)

```

Likewise, use your function to reformat date to create a new vector `new_date` 
by reformatting the values in column `Date`:

```{r}
# 'new_date' vector of class "Date"
new_date = reformat_date(clean_date)

```


### New vector `gender`

Create a __character__ vector `gender` filled with `"male"` values, having 
length equal to the number of rows in the men's data set.

```{r}
# vector 'gender'
gender = rep("male", nrow(mens_high_jump_raw))

```


### New data frame `mens`

Use the vectors `height`, `athlete`, `gender`, `country`, `city`, `new_date`, 
`day`, `month`, and `year` to build a new data frame `mens`. The column 
corresponding to `new_date` should have name `"date"`. Do NOT convert
character strings as factors:

```{r}
# data frame 'mens'
mens = data.frame(
  height = height,
  athlete = athlete,
  gender = gender,
  country = country,
  city = city,
  date = new_date,
  day = day,
  month = month,
  year = year,
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

```

-----

# Data Manipulation

Create a new data frame `records` by merging (or "stacking") the data frames 
`womens` and `mens`. Only the columns `gender` and `country` should be 
converted as R factors. Make sure that the column `date` is of class `"Date"`.

```{r}
# new data frame 'records'
records = rbind(womens, mens)
records[,3] = factor(records[,3])
records[,4] = factor(records[,4])
```

Use functions in `"dplyr"` to compute the following frequency tables. Assign
each table to its own object.

```{r}
# number of records per country
# object: per_country
per_country = records %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(records = n())

# invoke head() on per_country
head(per_country)
```

```{r}
# number of records per country in descending order
# object: per_country_desc
per_country_desc = per_country %>%
  arrange(desc(records))

# invoke head() on per_country_desc
head(per_country_desc)
```

```{r}
# number of records per year in descending order
# object: per_year_desc
per_year_desc = records %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(records = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(records))
  
# invoke head() on per_year_desc
head(per_year_desc)
```

```{r}
# number of records by gender
# object: by_gender
by_gender = records %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(records = n())

# invoke head() on by_gender
head(by_gender)
```

Here is one more challenge that involves some data wrangling with `year`.
The objective is to compute the number of records per decade (regardless of
gender):
```{r}
# number of records per decade (1920-1929, 1930-1939, 1940-1949, etc)
# object: per_decade
per_year = records %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(records = n()) %>%
  arrange(year)


intervals = seq(from = 1910, to = 2000, by = 10)
decade_records = integer(9)

for (i in 1:length(decade_records)){
  filtered_year = filter(per_year, year >= intervals[i] , year < intervals[i+1])
  filtered_records = filtered_year[,2]
  decade_records[i] = sum(filtered_records)
}
 
decade_names = c("1910-1919", "1920-1929", "1930-1939","1940-1949","1950-1959",
            "1960-1969","1970-1979","1980-1989","1990-1999")

per_decade = data.frame(
  decade = decade_names,
  records = decade_records,
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
# invoke head() on per_decade
head(per_decade)
```

# Data Visualization

Use the `records` data frame, and functions in `"ggplot2"`, to create charts 
similar to those displayed in the PDF with the instructions for this project:

- Include a title on all graphics
- Include a description for each graphic

```{r}
# step-line plot, with points, showing the progression of records
# (lines colored by gender)
# (the default ggplot color values are: '#00BFC4', '#F8766D')
date = records$date
height = records$height
gender = records$gender
ggplot(records, aes(x = date, y = height, group = gender)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = gender)) + 
  ggtitle("High Jump World Records Progression (by gender)") +
  geom_step(aes(color = gender)) + 
  theme_minimal() 
```

```{r}
# step-line plot, with points, showing the progression of records
# (facetting by gender)
ggplot(records, aes(x = records$date, y = records$height)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = gender)) + 
  geom_step(aes(color = gender)) + 
  ggtitle("High Jump World Records Progression (by gender)") + 
  facet_grid(~ gender)
```

```{r}
# step-line plot, with points, showing the progression of women records
# (points colored by country)
womens = filter(records, gender == "female")
date = womens$date
height = womens$height
Country = womens$country
ggplot(womens, aes(x = date, y = height)) +
  geom_step(color = "gray", size = 1) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Country)) + 
  ggtitle("Women's High Jump World Records Progression") + 
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
# step-line plot, with points, showing the progression of men records
# (points colored by country)
mens = filter(records, gender == "male")
date = mens$date
height = mens$height
Country = mens$country
ggplot(mens, aes(x = date, y = height)) +
  geom_step(color = "gray", size = 1) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Country)) + 
  ggtitle("Men's High Jump World Records Progression") + 
  theme_minimal()
```

# Model Fitting

Now let's do some basic model fitting with a simple regression analysis.


## Women's regression model

Subset the data `records` for those observations of gender `female`, and 
use the function `lm()` to compute a linear model by regressing `height` on
`year`:

```{r}
# Model for women
# regression of 'height' on 'year'
women = subset(records, gender == "female")
height = women$height
year = women$year
height_on_year_female = lm(height ~ year, data = women)
```

Use the object `"lm"` object in the previous step to compute a "prediction"
of what the women's high jump world record could have been in years: 
2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016.

```{r}
# predictions for olympic years
years_for_prediction = data.frame(
  year = c(2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016))
predict(height_on_year_female, years_for_prediction)
```


## Men's regression model

Subset the data `records` for those observations of gender `male`, and 
use the function `lm()` to compute a linear model by regressing `height` on
`year`:

```{r}
# Model for men
# regression of 'height' on 'year'
men = subset(records, gender == "male")
height = men$height
year = men$year
height_on_year_male = lm(height ~ year, data = men)
```

Use the object `"lm"` object in the previous step to compute a "prediction"
of what the men's high jump world record could have been in years: 
2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016.

```{r}
# predictions for olympic years
years_for_prediction = data.frame(
  year = c(2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016))
predict(height_on_year_male, years_for_prediction)
```

## Extra Credit

This part of the project is optional. If you provide a satisfactory solution,
you will get extra credit.

Consider the first women's world record which is 1.46 meters. This value
corresponds to "4 ft 9 1/2 in". Likewise, a height value of 2.04 meters can be 
expressed in US customary units as "6 ft 8 3/8 in".

The goal is to write a function that takes a height value (in meters), and 
which returns a character vector in US customary units. In other words, 
if you pass the value `1.46` to your function, the output will be the string 
`"4 ft 9 1/2 in"`.

You should be able to apply your function on the entire vector `height` to get 
the corresponding strings in US customary units. Your results should match the 
values in wikipedia's html tables.

Don't write a long function. You can use as many auxiliary short functions as
necessary. All the functions must be well documented with a general description
for the function's purpose, the arguments, and the output. Include these 
functions in the same `.R` script file with the other functions (those 
used to clean the columns of the raw data sets).

Your code should be accompanied with descriptions of how you approached this
problem, and the decisions you made to implement it in that way.
```{r}
# Code for testing
height_in_meters = records$height
for (i in 1:length(height_in_meters)){
  print(convert_height_units_numeric(height_in_meters[i]))
}
```
