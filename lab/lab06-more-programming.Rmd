# Women's High Jump World Record Progression

In this lab you will be working with data of world records in women's high jump
(source Wikipedia). The data set is in the file `womens-high-jump-records.csv` 
available in the `data/` folder from the github repository:

[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucb-stat133/stat133-fall-2016/master/data/womens-high-jump-records.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucb-stat133/stat133-fall-2016/master/data/womens-high-jump-records.csv.csv)


Assuming that the data file is already in your working directory, you can use 
any of the reading table functions to import it in R:
```{r read-data}
# read data
download.file(
  url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucb-stat133/stat133-fall-2016/master/data/womens-high-jump-records.csv', 
  destfile = '~/Desktop/STAT 133/stat133-my-repo/lab/womens-high-jump-records.csv')

dat <- read.csv("~/Desktop/STAT 133/stat133-my-repo/lab/womens-high-jump-records.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# take a peek
head(dat)
```

The data set has `r ncol(dat)` columns:

- `r names(dat)[1]` is the height record in meters
- `r names(dat)[2]` is the athlete's first name
- `r names(dat)[3]` is the athlete's last name
- `r names(dat)[4]` is the athlete's country
- `r names(dat)[5]` is the day of month (record's date)
- `r names(dat)[6]` is the name of month (record's date)
- `r names(dat)[7]` is the year (record's date)


## Athlete's name

The function `paste()`---and its sister `paste0()`---allows you to form
character strings by _pasting_ any number of vectors:

```{r paste}
paste("Go", "Bears", "!")
paste0("Go", "Bears", "!")
```


Use `paste()` to create a vector `athlete_name` that shows the
athlete's full name (first and last name)

```{r ath-name}
# your vector athlete_name

athlete_name = paste(dat$first, dat$last)
```


Take your vector `athlete_name`, and use `paste()` again, to create a vector 
`athlete` in which each element shows the full name followed by the country within parentheses, for example: `Nancy Voorhees (USA)`:

```{r athlete}
# your vector athlete

athlete_name_country = paste0(athlete_name,' ','(',dat$country,')')
```


## Name of the month

As you can tell, the column `month` has the names of the months in abbreviated 
format. But what if we want to get the full name? Interestingly, R comes
with a built-in vector `month.name` that has the full names of the months
 (in English). So let's use `month.name` to write code that converts an abbreviated 
month into its full name.

For testing purposes, let's consider one month, say `"Jan"`. 
One option is to use `switch()`. Complete the following call to `switch()`
with the corresponding months, and include an option `NA` at the end for
when the input does not match with any of the available switch values.
(Make sure to change the chunk option `eval = FALSE` to `eval = TRUE`).
```{r switch-month, eval = TRUE}
a <- "Jan"

switch(a,
       "Jan" = month.name[1],
       "Feb" = month.name[2],
       "Mar" = month.name[3], 
       "Apr" = month.name[4],
       "May" = month.name[5],
       "Jun" = month.name[6],
       "Jul" = month.name[7],
       "Aug" = month.name[8],
       "Sep" = month.name[9],
       "Oct" = month.name[10],
       "Nov" = month.name[11],
       "Dec" = month.name[12]
       )
```


Now encapsulate the `switch()` in a function `expand_month()`. This function
takes the abbreviated name, and returns the full name. In the code chunk, 
add a description of what the function does, what's the expected input, and
what's the returned value:

```{r expand-month}
# your expand_month() function

# This function is for expanding thenames of the months in abbreviated 
# format to full name
expand_month = function(abr){

  switch(abr,
       "Jan" = month.name[1],
       "Feb" = month.name[2],
       "Mar" = month.name[3], 
       "Apr" = month.name[4],
       "May" = month.name[5],
       "Jun" = month.name[6],
       "Jul" = month.name[7],
       "Aug" = month.name[8],
       "Sep" = month.name[9],
       "Oct" = month.name[10],
       "Nov" = month.name[11],
       "Dec" = month.name[12],
       "NA"
       )
}

expand_month("Apr")
expand_month("Xyz")
# test it with expand_month("Apr") and expand_month("Xyz")
```


Once you have your `expand_month()` function, the next task is to figure out 
how to use it so that you can take the vector `month` and convert all its 
values to abbreviated names. 


### For loop

One option to replace month names is to use a `for` loop. Compute a vector
`new_month` by writing a `for` loop that iterates through all the elements 
in `month`, and switches the value to full name, using `expand_month()`:

```{r}
new_month = c()
month = dat$month
# your for loop to get new_month
for (abr in month){
  full_name = expand_month(abr) 
  new_month = c(new_month, full_name)
}


for (i in 1:nrow(dat)){
  new_month[i] = expand_month(dat$month[i])
}
```


Another alternative is to use one of the functions from the `apply` family:
`lapply()` and `sapply()`. Check the documentation for `lapply()` and
`sapply()`, and see some examples. Even better, take the column `month`, 
your `expand_month()` function, and pass them to both `lapply()` and 
`sapply()` and see what happens:

```{r lapply-sapply}
# use lapply and sapply
lapply(month, function(x) expand_month(x)) # give list
sapply(month, function(x) expand_month(x)) # names vector
```

Build a vector `full_month` with the full name:
```{r full-month}
# your vector full_month
full_month = sapply(month, function(x) expand_month(x))
```


## Record dates

Take the vectors `full_month`, `day`, and `year`, and `paste()` them---in that
order---to build a vector `record_dates` with the format `"May-20-1922", "May-26-1923", ...`

```{r record-dates}
# your vector record_dates
record_dates = paste(full_month, dat$day, dat$year, sep = "-")

```

Your vector `record_dates` is just a character vector. But you can use it to 
get a vector of class `"Date"`. Check the documentation of the function 
`as.Date()` in order to reformat your vector `record_dates` with 
`"%B-%d-%Y"` format:

```{r as-record-date}
# date formatting
# complete as necessary: record_dates <- as.Date(record_dates, ...)

record_dates <- as.Date(record_dates, format = "%B-%d-%Y")
```

Apply `paste()` one more time to the vectors `day`, `full_month`, and `year`, in this order, to build a vector `dates`: e.g. `"20 May 1922", "26 May 1923", ...`

```{r dates}
# your vector dates

dates = paste(dat$day, full_month, dat$year)
```

Use `as.Date()` one more time to reformat your vector `dates` with 
`"%d %B %Y"` format:

```{r as-date}
# date formatting
# complete as necessary: dates <- as.Date(dates, ...)

dates = as.Date(dates, format = "%d %B %Y")

```


# Derived Data Frame

The next task consists of building a new data frame `womens` using the
vectors `height`, `athlete_name`, `country`, and `date`. When building the 
data frame use the following column names:

- `Height = height`
- `Athlete = athlete_name` 
- `Country = country`
- `Date = dates`


```{r}
# your data frame "womens"
womens = data.frame(
  Height = dat$height,
  Athelete = athlete_name,
  Country = dat$country,
  Data = dates
)
```


# Manipulating data with `"dplyr"`

Let's do some data manipulation and aggregation with the R package `"dplyr"`:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

Begin by extracting the distinct (unique) countries:

```{r unique-countries}
# distinct countries
unique_countries = dat %>% distinct(country) 
```

The column `height` in the original data frame `dat` is in meters. You can use
`transmute()` to compute a vector `height_inches` (1 meter = 39.3701 inches):

```{r height-inches}
# compute vector of height in inches
height_inches = transmute(dat, height_inches = height * 39.3701)
```

Likewise, you can use the function `mutate()` to add a new column 
`height_inches` to `dat`:

```{r column-height-inches}
# add column height_inches to dat
dat = mutate(dat, height_inches = height * 39.3701)
```


Take the original data frame `dat` and use `"dplyr"` to compute the:

- number of records per country
- number of records per country in decreasing order
- number of records per year
- number of records per year in decresing order


```{r per-country-year}
# records per country
per_country = dat %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(records = n())

# records per country in descending order
per_country_desc = per_country %>%
  arrange(desc(records))
per_country_desc

# records per year
per_year = dat %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(records = n())
per_year

# records per year in descending order
per_year_desc = per_year %>%
  arrange(desc(records))
per_year_desc
```


Now take the data frame `womens` and use `"dplyr"` to compute the:

- number of records per athlete
- number of records per athlete in decreasing order

```{r per-athlete}
# number of records per country
per_athlete = womens %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  summarise(record = n())
per_athlete
# number of records per country in decreasing order
per_athlete_desc = per_athlete %>%
  arrange(desc(record))
per_athlete_desc
```


# Visualizing Records with `"ggplot2"`

Now that you have the `dat` and `womens` data frame, let's use `"ggplot2"` to 
get some plots:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

Take `dat` and get a bar-chart with the number of records per country, with 
bars in descending order:
```{r bar-chart}
# your scatterplot
ggplot(dat, aes(x = country)) +
  geom_bar() + 
  scale_x_discrete(limits = per_country_desc$country)

```

Now take `womens` and use `geom_point()` to get a scatterplot of `x = Date` and 
`y = Height`. Add a title `"Women's High Jump Record Progression"`.
```{r scatterplot}
# your scatterplot
ggplot(womens, aes(x = Date, y = Height)) +
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("Women's High Jump Record Progression")
```


Now add a line, you can try using `geom_line()`
```{r geom-line}
# scatterplot with line
```

Instead of adding a simple line, use the `geom_step()` line:
```{r geom-step}
# scatterplot with step line
```

Now use `Country` to color the points 
```{r color-country}
# scatterplot with step line, color points by country
```
