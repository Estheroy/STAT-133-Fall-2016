## R and RStudio

- Make sure everybody has installed __R__
	- R for Mac: [https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)
	- R for windows: [https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
- Make sure everybody has installed __RStudio__
	- RStudio download: [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
- Difference between R-GUI and RStudio
	- R-GUI is a simply graphical user interface
	- RStudio is an _Integrated Development Environment_ (IDE)
		- It is much more than a simple GUI
		- It provides a nice working environment and development framework
- We are going to use mainly RStudio

## R as a scientific calculator

Open RStudio and locate the _console_ (or prompt)
Let's start typing basic things in the console, using R as a scientific calculator
```r
# addition
1 + 1
2 + 3

# subtraction
4 - 2
5 - 7

# multiplication
10 * 0
7 * 7

# division
9 / 3
1 / 2

# power
2 ^ 2
3 ^ 3
```

### Functions

R has many functions. To use a function type its name followed by parenthesis.
Inside the parenthesis you pass an input. Most functions will produce some
type of output:
```r
# absolute value
abs(10)
abs(-4)

# square root
sqrt(9)

# natural logarithm
log(2)
```

### Comments in R

All programming languages use a set of characters to indicate that a
specifc part or lines of code are __comments__, that is, things that are
not to be executed. R uses the hash or pound symbol `#` to specify comments.
Any code to the right of `#` will not be executed by R.
```r
# this is a comment
# this is another comment
2 * 9

4 + 5  # you can place comments like this
```


### Variables and Assignment

R is more powerful than a calculator, and you can do many more things than
practically most scientific calculators. One of the things you will be
doing a lot in R is creating variables or objects to store values.

For instance, you can create a variable `x` and give it the value of 1.
This is done using what is known as the __assignment operator__ `<-`,
also known in R as the _arrow_ operator:
```r
x <- 1
x
```
This is a way to tell R: create an object `x` and store in it the number 1.
Alternatively, you can use the equals sign `=` as an assignment operator:
```r
y = 2
y
```

With variables, you can operate the way you do algebraic operations:
```r
x + y
x - y
x * y
x / y
x ^ y
```


### Case Sensitive

R is case sensitive. This means that `abs()` is not the same
as `Abs()` or `ABS()`. Only the function `abs()` is the valid one.
```r
# case sensitive
x <- 1
X <- 2
x + x
x + X
X + X
```

### Some Examples

Here are some examples that illustrate how to use R to define
variables and perform basic calculations:
```r
# convert Fahrenheit degrees to Celsius degrees
fahrenheit <- 50
celsius <- (fahrenheit - 32) * (5/9)
print(celsius)


# compute the area of a rectangle
rec_length <- 10
rec_height <- 5
rec_area <- rec_length * rec_height
rec_area


# degrees to radians
deg <- 90
rad <- (deg * pi) / 180
rad


# toss a fair coin 5 times, chance of 3 heads
chance_heads <- 0.5
dbinom(3, 5, prob = chance_heads)
```

## More about RStudio

You will be working with RStudio a lot, and you will have time to learn
most of the bells and whistles RStudio provides. Think about RStudio as
your "workbench". Keep in mind that RStudio is NOT R. RStudio is an environment
that makes it easier to work with R, while handling taking care of many of
the little tasks than can be a hassle.


### A quick tour of RStudio

- Understand the __pane layout__ (i.e. windows) of RStudio
	- Source
	- Console
	- Environment, History, etc
	- Files, Plots, Packages, Help, Viewer
- Customize RStudio Appearance of source pane
  - font
  - size
  - background


### Using an R script file

Most of the times you won't be working directly on the console.
Instead, you will be typing your commands in some source file.
The basic type of source files are known as _R script files_.
Open a new script file in the _source_ pane, and rewrite the
previous commands.

You can copy the commands in your source file and paste them in the
console. But that's not very efficient. Find out how to run (execute)
the commands (in your source file) and pass them to the console pane.


### Getting help

Because we work with functions all the time, it's important to know certain
details about how to use them, what input(s) is required, and what is the
returned output.

There are several ways to get help.

If you know the name of a function you are interested in knowing more,
you can use the function `help()` and pass it the name of the function you
are looking for:
```r
# documentation about the 'abs' function
help(abs)

# documentation about the 'mean' function
help(mean)
```

Alternatively, you can use a shortcut using the question mark `?` followed
by the name of the function:
```r
# documentation about the 'abs' function
?abs

# documentation about the 'mean' function
?mean
```

- How to read the manual documentation
	- Title
	- Description
	- Usage of function
	- Arguments
	- Details
	- See Also
	- Examples!!!

`help()` only works if you know the name of the function your are looking for.
Sometimes, however, you don't know the name but you may know some keywords.
To look for related functions associated to a keyword, use double
`help.search()` or simply `??`
```r
# search for 'absolute'
help.search("absolute")

# alternatively you can also search like this:
??absolute
```
Notice the use of quotes surrounding the input name inside `help.search()`


### Installing Packages

R comes with a large set of functions and packages. A package is a collection
of functions that have been designed for a specific purpose. One of the great
advantages of R is that many analysts, scientists, programmers, and users
can create their own pacakages and make them available for everybody to use them.
R packages can be shared in different ways. The most common way to share a
package is to submit it to what is known as __CRAN__, the
_Comprehensive R Archive Network_.

You can install a package using the `install.packages()` function.
Just give it the name of a package, surrounded by qoutes, and R will look for
it in CRAN, and if it finds it, R will download it to your computer.
```r
# installing
install.packages("knitr")
```

You can also install a bunch of packages at once:
```r
install.packages(c("readr", "ggplot2"))
```

Once you installed a package, you can start using its functions
by _loading_ the package with the function `library()`
```r
library(knitr)
```


### Your turn

- Install packages `"stringr"`, `"RColorBrewer"`

```r
# install.packages("stringr")
# install.packages("RColorBrewer")
```

- Calculate: $3x^2 + 4x + 8$ when $x = 2$

```r
x = 2
3 * x ^ 2 + 4 * x + 8
```

- Look for the man (i.e. help) documentation of the function `exp`

```r
help("exp")
```
- Find out how to look for information about binary operators
like `+` or `^`

```r
help.search("operator")
```

- There are several tabs in the pane `Files, Plots, Packages, Help, Viewer`.
Find what does the tab __Files__ is good for?

```r
# For selecting the files in the working directory (The current folder where the file locates)
```

## Introduction to Markdown

Besides using R script files to write source code, you will be using other
type of source files known as _R markdown_ files. These files use a special
syntax called __markdown__.


### Get to know the `Rmd` files

In the menu bar of RStudio, click on __File__, then __New File__,
and choose __R Markdown__. Select the default option (Document),
and click __Ok__.

__Rmd__ files are a special type of file, referred to as a _dynamic document_,
that allows to combine narrative (text) with R code. Because you will
be turning in most homework assignments as `Rmd` files, it is important
that you quickly become familiar with this resource.

Locate the button __Knit HTML__ (the one with a knitting icon) and click on it
so you can see how `Rmd` files are renderer and displayed as HTML documents.


### Yet Another Syntax to Learn

R markdown (`Rmd`) files use [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
as the main syntax to write content. It is a very lightweight type of
markup language, and it is relatively easy to learn.


### Your turn

Work through the markdown tutorial:
[www.markdown-tutorial.com](http://www.markdown-tutorial.com)

Your turn: After lab discussion, find some time to go through this
additional markdown tutorial
[www.markdowntutorial.com/](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/)

RStudio has a very comprehensive R Markdown tutorial:
