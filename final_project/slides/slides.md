Introduction
========================================================

This project focuses on the dataset of basketball players from National Basketball 
Association (NBA) League in the 2015-2016 season. We wil analyse the relationship between these playersâ€™ performance and their salaries.

Methodology
========================================================
- Data Cleaning
- EDA
- Team Statistics
- Player Performance
- Player Value
- Shiny apps 

Data Cleaning
========================================================
- merge(): roster, totals, and salary tables for each team
- cbind(): Stack all the tables
- duplicated(): check duplicate players
- Remove duplicated players  


EDA
========================================================

For EDA we have 2 types of data, quantitative data and qualitative data.  
We use bar chart to analyze qualitative data.

EDA
========================================================

We use box plot and histogram to analyze quantitative data

Player Performance
========================================================
We use "efficiency"(EFF) to evaluate a professional basketball player's value.

 Wi: weights	                               
 sigma i: standard deviation                
 EFF: efficiency	 
 PTS: total points	 
 REB: total rebounds  
***

 AST: assists 
 STL: steals		
 BLK: blocks		
 TO: turnovers		
 GP: games played  
 Missed FT: missed free throws		
 Missed FG: missed field goals

Shiny apps 
========================================================
- "team-salaris"

Results

- Player position analysis

Conclusion
========================================================
- EFF projects the highest possitive correlation with salary
- Number of missed field goals has the strongest negative impact on salary 
- Low efficiency players are more likely to be underpaid 
- High efficiency players are more likely to be overpaid
- Point guards and Shooting guards are underpaid on average
- Power forward and Center players are overpaid on average  



Take home message
========================================================
- Except for efficiency, what else will affect the underpaid and overpaid?
- For example: age, height, .etc
